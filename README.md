##The Idea

We want to make it easy for people that are new to UCSC (or not-so-new) to be able to find all of the cool hidden treasures around campus and visit them. We have such a cool campus, let's help others learn about it! Ideally this project will be social and easily portable to other platforms (though for the five weeks we have, we'll stick with just Android).
